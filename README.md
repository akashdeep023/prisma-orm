# Prisma ORM

## What are ORMs

1. **Boring official defination**
    - ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, a programming technique used in software development to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This technique creates a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.
    - ORMs are used to abstract the complexities of the underlying database into simpler, more easily managed objects within the code
2. **Easier to digest defination**
    - ORMs let you easily interact with your database without worrying too much about the underlying syntax (SQL language for eg)

## Why ORMs?

1. Simpler syntax (converts objects to SQL queries under the hood)

    ```ts
    // Non ORM
    const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1`;
    const result = await client.query(query, ["jack@jack.com"]);
    ```

    ```ts
    // ORM
    User.find({
    	email: "jack@jack.com",
    });
    ```

2. Abstraction that lets you flip the database you are using. Unified API irrespective of the DB

    ```ts
    // Postgresql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = "jack@jack.com";

    // MongoDb
    mongoose.find({email: "jack@jack.com"});

    // ORM
    User.find({
    	email: "jack@jack.com",
    });
    ```

3. Type safety/Auto completion

    ```ts
    // Non ORM
    const result: any;

    // ORM
    const result: User;
    ```

4. Automatic migrations

    - In case of a simple Postgres app, itâ€™s very hard to keep track of all the commands that were ran that led to the current schema of the table.

    ```
    // Users            |   // Todos
    username: string    |   title: string
    password: string    |   description: string
    firstName: string   |   done: boolean
    lastName: string    |   user_id: number
    ```

    ```ts
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
    );

    ALTER TABLE users
    ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(15);
    ```

-   As your app grows, you will have a lot of these `CREATE` and `ALTER` commands.
-   ORMs (or more specifically Prisma) maintains all of these for you.
